#smv is the movie capture format of Snes9x emulators

## SMV 1.43 file format description ##
SMV file consists of a 32-byte header and various blocks that depend on settings.

### Header format: ###
```
000 4-byte signature: 53 4D 56 1A "SMV\x1A"
004 4-byte little-endian unsigned int: version number, must be 1
008 4-byte little-endian integer: movie "uid" - identifies the movie-savestate relationship, also used as the recording time in Unix epoch format
00C 4-byte little-endian unsigned int: rerecord count
010 4-byte little-endian unsigned int: number of frames
014 1-byte flags "controller mask":
    bit 0: controller 1 in use
    bit 1: controller 2 in use
    bit 2: controller 3 in use
    bit 3: controller 4 in use
    bit 4: controller 5 in use
    other: reserved, set to 0
015 1-byte flags "movie options":
    bit 0:
       if "0", movie begins from an embedded "quicksave" snapshot
       if "1", a SRAM is included instead of a quicksave; movie begins from reset
    bit 1: if "0", movie is NTSC (60 fps); if "1", movie is PAL (50 fps)
    other: reserved, set to 0
016 1-byte flags "sync options":
    bit 0: MOVIE_SYNC2_INIT_FASTROM
    other: reserved, set to 0
017 1-byte flags "sync options":
    bit 0: MOVIE_SYNC_DATA_EXISTS
       if "1", all sync options flags are defined.
       if "0", all sync options flags have no meaning.
    bit 1: MOVIE_SYNC_WIP1TIMING
    bit 2: MOVIE_SYNC_LEFTRIGHT
    bit 3: MOVIE_SYNC_VOLUMEENVX
    bit 4: MOVIE_SYNC_FAKEMUTE
    bit 5: MOVIE_SYNC_SYNCSOUND
    bit 6: MOVIE_SYNC_HASROMINFO
       if "1", there is extra ROM info located right in between of the metadata and the savestate.
    bit 7: set to 0.
018 4-byte little-endian unsigned int: offset to the savestate inside file
01C 4-byte little-endian unsigned int: offset to the controller data inside file
```

### Metadata ###
After the header comes "metadata", which is UTF16-coded movie title string (author info). The metadata begins from position 32 (0x20) and ends at <savestate\_offset - length\_of\_extra\_rom\_info\_in\_bytes>.

### Extra ROM info ###
Extra ROM info is an optional 30-byte record which contains the following structure:

> 000 3 bytes of zero padding: 00 00 00
> 003 4-byte integer: CRC32 of the ROM
> 007 23-byte ascii string:
> > the game name copied from the ROM, truncated to 23 bytes
> > (the game name in the ROM is 21 bytes)

Extra ROM info is always positioned right before the savestate.
Its size is 30 bytes if MOVIE\_SYNC\_HASROMINFO is used (and MOVIE\_SYNC\_DATA\_EXISTS is set), 0 bytes otherwise.

### Savestates ###
The savestate offset is <32 + length\_of\_metadata\_in\_bytes + length\_of\_extra\_rom\_info\_in\_bytes>.
At the savestate offset there is a gzip-compressed file.

  * If the movie is snapshot-anchored, it is a structured Snes9x savestate.
  * If the movie is reset-anchored, it is a SRAM snapshot (which should decompress into 0x20000 bytes in length).

### Controller data ###
The controller data offset is <savestate\_offset + length\_of\_compressed\_savestate>.
The controller data contains <number\_of\_frames + 1> frames. Each frame consists of 2 bytes per controller. So if there are 3 controllers, a frame is 6 bytes and if there is only 1 controller, a frame is 2 bytes.

Note that the savestate data must come before controller data - Snes9x uses the savestate offset to calculate the length of the metadata.
A gap between the savestate data and the controller data is allowed.

Each value is determined by OR-ing together values for whichever of the following are pressed:
```
  01 00 (reserved)
  02 00 (reserved)
  04 00 (reserved)
  08 00 (reserved)
  10 00 R
  20 00 L
  40 00 X
  80 00 A
  00 01 Right
  00 02 Left
  00 04 Down
  00 08 Up
  00 10 Start
  00 20 Select
  00 40 Y
  00 80 B
```

In the reset-recording patch, a frame that contains the value FF FF for every controller denotes a reset. The reset is done through the S9xSoftReset routine.
